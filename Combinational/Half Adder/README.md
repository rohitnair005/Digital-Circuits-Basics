Overview
      A Half Adder is a basic combinational digital circuit that performs the addition of two single-bit binary numbers. It produces two outputs: Sum and Carry.

Theory
    The Half Adder adds two inputs A and B.
        Sum (S) = A ⊕ B
        Carry (C) = A · B
        
Truth Table
      A B Sum (S) Carry (C)
      0 0 0 0
      0 1 1 0
      1 0 1 0
      1 1 0 1
